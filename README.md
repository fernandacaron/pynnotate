## üíæ Installation

### Terminal version

The terminal version of *pynnotate* is recommended for users who prefer to run the tool via command line or integrate it into automated pipelines. This method works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

> **Requirements:**  
> - Python **3.8 or newer** must be installed.  
> - To check if Python is installed, run:  
>   ```bash
>   python --version
>   ```
>   or  
>   ```bash
>   python3 --version
>   ```
> - If Python is not installed:  
>   - **Windows**: [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and check ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù during installation.  
>   - **macOS**: Install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) or use Homebrew:  
>     ```bash
>     brew install python
>     ```
>   - **Linux**: Use your package manager, e.g.:  
>     ```bash
>     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
>     ```

1. Clone the GitHub repository:  

   If you have issues with SSH authentication, use the HTTPS version below (recommended for most users):

   **HTTPS (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fernandacaron/pynnotate.git
   ```

   **SSH (for users with SSH keys configured)**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:fernandacaron/pynnotate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd pynnotate
   ```

3. Install *pynnotate*:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Test if the programme runs:

   ```bash
   pynnotate --help
   ```

   Or run the example:

   ```bash
   pynnotate --config pynnotate/examples/config.yaml
   ```

### Graphical version (GUI)

For ease of use, we provide a ready-to-use graphical version compiled for major operating systems.

1. Go to the Releases page on GitHub
2. Download the installer for your system
3. Install/unpack and run the programme by clicking its icon
4. The graphical interface will open, allowing you to configure and run all functions without the terminal

---

## üß™ Usage example

### Graphical version

1. Set a gene (e.g., COI) and an organism (e.g., Anura)  
2. Click ‚Äúüíæ Search and download sequences‚Äù  
3. The programme will search, download, and extract the data automatically  
4. View the generated files in the chosen location  

### Terminal version

Pynnotate uses a YAML configuration file to simplify option settings. An example file is available in the `examples/` folder of the repository, named `config.yaml`.

Run with the YAML file:

```bash
pynnotate --config pynnotate/examples/config.yaml
```

#### Important notes:

- The YAML file groups all configurations, avoiding the need for multiple command-line arguments.  
- Ensure that all file paths in the YAML are correct.  
- To see all available options and their descriptions, run:

```bash
pynnotate --help
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Argument Details

*Pynnotate* is a command-line tool that accepts various arguments to customise the search, download, and extraction of sequences from GenBank. Below is a detailed description of each argument available in the current code.

#### **Mandatory Arguments**

##### `-c` or `--config`

Description: Path to the YAML configuration file containing all options to run *pynnotate*.

> Note: The YAML file groups all settings, making it easier to use without multiple command-line arguments. An example is available in the `examples/` folder.

#### **Mandatory Arguments in the YAML File**

To run Pynnotate correctly via terminal, you must provide a YAML configuration file with at least the following required fields:

##### `-e` or `--email`

Description: Your valid email, required by NCBI Entrez for identification and access to GenBank.

##### `-o` or `--output`

Description: Directory where output files will be saved (the folder name can also be provided via the `--folder` argument, but it is not mandatory).

##### `-t` or `--type`

Description: Type of genome/organism to determine the synonym dictionary. Accepted values: *animal_mito, plant_mito, plant_chloro, other*.

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: Genome type selection affects gene extraction and filtering. When extraction is disabled, all sequences matching your search will be downloaded regardless of genome type.

##### `-f` or `--filter-mode`

Description: Defines how sequences will be filtered by species. This parameter is essential to control redundancy and the structure of your dataset.

**Accepted values:**

üåê Unconstrained: Includes all available sequences regardless of redundancy. Useful when you want to manually explore or curate all records.

üå± Flexible: Allows multiple sequences per species only if each new sequence adds different genes (e.g., in supermatrix analyses).

üîí Strict: Includes only one sequence per species, prioritising the one with the highest number of genes present in the main dictionary or in the dictionary provided by the user.

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: In strict mode, the filter considers the genes listed in the default synonym dictionary and/or the dictionary provided by the user.

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: When the unconstrained mode is used in combination with separate gene extraction (`--extraction`), all sequences corresponding to the selected genes will be downloaded, even if there are multiple records per species.

**üö® In addition, you must include either `--accession` or a search term in the query (`--genes`, `--organism`, `--publication` or `--additional`) to indicate the data search.**

#### **Optional Arguments (via YAML or Command Line)**

##### `--accession`

Description: List of GenBank IDs (accessions) to download. Can be null if using a query argument.

> Note: Use only if you want to search for specific IDs instead of using a query.

##### `--genes`

Description: Comma-separated list of genes to search and download (e.g., COI, CYTB, ATP6).

> Note: Extracts only the listed genes; otherwise, all known genes are extracted.

##### `-organism`

Description: Organisms to search and download (e.g., species, family).

##### `--publication`

Description: Publication term (e.g., title, authors, year).

##### `--additional`

Description: Any additional search term (e.g., NOT sp).

##### `--mitochondrialgene`

Description: Boolean. Refine search terms to "mitochondrial genes".

##### `--mitogenome`

Description: Boolean. Refine search terms to "mitogenomes".

##### `--chloroplast`

Description: Boolean. Refine search terms to "chloroplast".

##### `--annotated`

Description: Boolean. Exclude unannotated records.

##### `--header`

Description: Fields for sequence headers (GenBank fields).

##### `--genbankid`

Description: Boolean. Include GenBank ID in the fasta headers.

##### `--prioritize`

Description: Boolean. Prioritise individuals with more genes (valid for mitochondrial genes).

##### `--add_synonyms`

Description: Additional synonyms for gene names in JSON format. Pynnotate already includes an internal dictionary of gene name synonyms to assist in extraction. You can provide additional synonyms for genes not automatically recognised. We recommend running the program first to identify any unrecognised gene synonyms. Add any missing synonyms here to improve matching.

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: When selecting the genome type and adding synonyms, they will be incorporated into the internal dictionary for that specific genome type. However, if the selected genome type is 'other', only user-provided synonyms will be used.

##### `--min_bp`

Description: Defines the minimum allowed length for a sequence to be retained.

##### `--max_bp`

Description: Defines the maximum allowed length for a sequence to be retained.

##### `--extraction`

Description: Boolean. If True, extracts all genes separately, grouping different individuals/species into the respective files for each gene.

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: Gene extraction will be limited to the selected synonym dictionary. For example, when selecting 'plant_chloro', only chloroplast genes will be extracted.

##### `--overlap`

Description: Boolean. Adjust overlap between extracted genes.

##### `--logmissing`

Description: Boolean. Generate a log of missing species per sample (useful for mitogenomes).

##### `--folder`

Description: Name of the folder to create inside the output directory (will be automatically created with a predefined name if the argument is not provided).

#### **Other Options**

##### `-h` or `--help`

Description: Shows help with the complete list of arguments and their descriptions.

## üßæ Generated files

After running, *pynnotate* creates the following in the specified output directory:

1. `sequences.fasta`: Extracted sequences without gene separation.  
2. `log.txt`: Execution log for debugging and traceability.  
3. `metadata.xlsx`: Metadata from GenBank for each sequence.  
4. `genes_matrix.xlsx`: Presence/absence matrix of genes in downloaded records, with accession numbers.  
5. `genes/`: Folder containing sequences separated by gene.
